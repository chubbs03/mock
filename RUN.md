# 🚀 START THE APP

## One Command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Then Open:

**http://localhost:5173**

---

## That's it! 🎉

The app now runs entirely in the browser:
- ✅ No backend needed
- ✅ Real patient data from Hugging Face
- ✅ AI chat with DeepSeek
- ✅ All vitals tracking (BP, HR, Glucose, SpO2)

---

## First Time Setup:

If you haven't installed dependencies yet:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Troubleshooting:

### "npm: command not found"
Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org

### Port already in use
```bash
# Kill the process on port 5173
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
npm run dev
```

### Dependencies error
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
